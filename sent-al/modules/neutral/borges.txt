handwritten additions), and Montaner y Sim6n's Hispano American Dictionary, purchased because it could be paid for in installments and because of the little dictionary stand that came with it
The family lived on a small pension, which always arrived late, and also received rent from a piece of land (the sole remnant of the once vast cattle ranch) in Lomas de Zamora
At the date of my story the elderly lady was living with Julia, who had been widowed, and one of Julia's sons
She still abominated Artigas, Rosas, and Urquiza
World War I, which made her detest Germans (about whom she knew very little), was less real to her than the 1890 Revolution and the charge on Cerro Alto
Since 1932 her mind had been gradually growing dimmer; the best metaphors are the common ones, for they are the only true ones
She was, of course, a Catholic, which did not mean that she believed in a God Who Is Three yet One, or even in the immortality of the soul
She murmured prayers she did not understand and her fingers told her beads
Instead of the Paschal and Three Kings' Day celebrations that were the custom in Argentina, she had come to adopt Christmas, and to drink tea rather than mate
The words Protestant, Jew, Mason, heretic, and atheist were all synonymous to her, and all meaningless
So long as she was able, she spoke not of Spaniards but of Goths, as her parents had
In 1910 she refused to believe that the Infanta, who after all was a princess, spoke, against all one's expectations, like a common Galician and not like an Argentine lady
It was at her son in law's wake that she was told this startling news by a rich relative (who had never set foot in the house though the family eagerly looked for mention of her in the social columns of the newspaper)
The names the elderly lady called things by were always out of date: she spoke of the Calle de las Artes, the Calle del Temple, the Calle Buen Orden, the Calle de la Piedad, the Dos Calles Largas, the Plaza del Parque, and the Plaza de los Portones
What were affectations in other members of the family (who would say Easterners instead of Uruguayans,* for instance) came naturally to the widow Jauregui
She never left her house; she may never have suspected that with the years Buenos Aires had grown and changed
One's first memories are the most vivid ones; the city that the elderly lady saw in her mind's eye on the other side of the front door was no doubt a much earlier one than the city that existed at the time they'd had to move toward the outskirts; the oxen of the oxcarts must still have stood at rest in Plaza del Once,* and dead violets still have perfumed the country houses of Barracas
* All I dream about now is dead men was one of the last things she was heard to say
She was never stupid, but she had never, so far as I know, enjoyed the pleasures of the intellect; there remained to her the pleasures of memory, and then, forgetfulness
She was always generous
I recall her tranquil blue eyes and her smile
Who can say what tumult of passions (now lost but erstwhile burning brightly) there had been in that old woman who had once been so charming and well favored
Sensitive to plants, whose modest, silent life was so much like her own, she raised begonias in her room and touched the leaves she could not see
Until 1929, when she fell into her reverie, she would tell stories of historical events, but always with the same words and in the same order, as though they were the Paternoster, and I suspect that after a while they no longer corresponded to images in her mind
She had no marked preferences in food
She was, in a word, happy
Sleeping, as we all know, is the most secret thing we do
We devote one third of our lives to sleep, yet we do not understand it
Some believe it is only an eclipse of wakefulness; others, a more complex state which embraces at once yesterday, the present, and tomorrow; still others see it as an uninterrupted series of dreams
To say that the elderly lady of my story spent ten years in a state of serene chaos is perhaps an error; every moment of those ten years may have been pure present, without past or future
If so, we should not marvel overmuch at that present (which in our own case we count in days and nights and hundreds of pages torn from many calendars, and in anxieties and events ) we voyage through it every morning before we are fully awake and every night before we fall asleep
Twice every day we are that elderly lady
The Jaureguis lived, as we have seen, in a somewhat equivocal position
They saw themselves as members of the aristocracy, but those who made up that class knew nothing of them; they were the descendants of a national hero, but most textbooks omitted his name
It was true that a street commemorated Colonel Mariano Rubio, but that street, which very few people were familiar with, was lost behind the cemetery on the west side of the city
The day of her centennial was drawing near
On the tenth, a uniformed soldier appeared with a letter signed by the minister himself, announcing his visit on the fourteenth
The Jaureguis showed the letter to the entire neighborhood, pointing out the engraved letterhead and the minister's personal signature
The journalists who would be writing the newspaper reports then began dropping by
They were given all the facts; it was obvious they'd never in their lives heard of Colonel Rubio
Virtual strangers called on the telephone, hoping the family would invite them to the celebration
The household labored diligently in preparation for the great day
They waxed the floors, washed the windows, removed the muslin covers from thechandeliers, shined the mahogany, polished the silver in the china cabinet, rearranged the furniture, and opened the piano in the parlor in order to show off the velvet keyboard cover
There was much scurrying about
The only person not involved in the bustle of activity was the elderly lady herself, who appeared not to understand what was going on
She would smile; Julia, with the help of the maid, dressed her smartly and arranged her hair, as though she were already dead
The first thing visitors would see when they carne in the door was the oil portrait of the hero, and then, a little lower and to the right, the sword of his many battles
Even in the most penurious times, the family had refused to sell it; they planned to donate it to the Museum of History
A neighbor very thoughtfully lent them a pot of geraniums for the occasion
The party was to begin at seven
The invitations gave the hour as sixthirty because the family knew everyone would come a little late, so as not to be the first to arrive
At seven ten not a soul had come; somewhat acrimoniously, the family discussed the advantages and disadvantages of tardiness: Elvira, who prided herself on her punctuality, declared it was an unforgivable discourtesy to leave people waiting; Julia, repeating the words of her late husband, replied that visitors who arrived late showed their consideration, since if everyone arrives a little late it's more comfortable all around, and no one has to feel rushed
By seven fifteen not another soul could squeeze into the house
The entire neighborhood could see and envy Sra
Figueroa's car and driver* (or chauffeur, as she was heard to call him); she almost never invited the sisters to her house, but they greeted her effusively, so nobody would suspect that they saw each other only once in a blue moon
The president sent his aide de camp, a very charming gentleman who said it was an honor to shake the hand of the daughter of the hero of Cerro Alto
The minister, who had to leave early, read a most high sounding speech filled with excellent epigrams, in which, however, he spoke more of San Martin than of Colonel Rubio
The elderly lady sat in her chair amid the cushions, and at times her head would nod or she would drop her fan
A group of distinguished females, the Ladies of the Nation, sang the national anthem to her, though she seemed not to hear
Photographers arranged the guests into artistic groupings, and their flashbulbs dazzled the celebrants'eyes
There were not enough little glasses of port and sherry to go around
Several bottles of champagne were uncorked
The elderly lady spoke not a single word; she may not have known who she was
From that night onward she was bedridden
