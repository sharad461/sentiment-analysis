In these lectures, I would like to focus attention on the question, What contribution can the study of language make to our understanding of human nature
In one or another manifestation, this question threads its way through modern Western thought
In an age that was less self conscious and less compartmentalized than ours, the nature of language, the respects in which language mirrors human mental processes or shapes the flow and character of thought these were topics for study and speculation by scholars and gifted amateurs with a wide variety of interests, points of view, and intellectual backgrounds
And in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as linguistics, philosophy, and psychology have uneasily tried to go their separate ways, the classical problems of language and mind have inevitably reappeared and have served to link these diverging fields and to give direction and significance to their efforts
There have been signs in the past decade that the rather artificial separation of disciplines may be coming to an end
It is no longer a point of honor for each to demonstrate its absolute independence of the others, and new interests have emerged that permit the classical problems to be formulated in novel and occasionally suggestive ways for example, in terms of the new perspectives provided by cybernetics and the communication sciences, and against the background of developments in comparative and physiological psychology that challenge long standing convictions and free the scientific imagination from certain shackles that had become so familiar a part of our intellectual environment as to be almost beyond awareness
All of this is highly encouraging
I think there is more of a healthy ferment in cognitive psychology and in the particular branch of cognitive psychology known as linguistics than there has been for many years
And one of the most encouraging signs is that skepticism with regard to the orthodoxies of the recent past is coupled with an awareness of the temptations and the dangers of premature orthodoxy, an awareness that, if it can persist, may prevent the rise of new and stultifying dogma
It is easy to be misled in an assessment of the current scene; nevertheless, it seems to me that the decline of dogmatism and the accompanying search for new approaches to old and often still intractable problems are quite unmistakable, not only in linguistics but in all of the disciplines concerned with the study of mind
I remember quite clearly my own feeling of uneasiness as a student at the fact that, so it seemed, the basic problems of the field were solved, and that what remained was to sharpen and improve techniques of linguistic analysis that were reasonably well understood and to apply them to a wider range of linguistic materials
In the postwar years, this was a dominant attitude in most active centers of research
I recall being told by a distinguished anthropological linguist, in 1953, that he had no intention of working through a vast collection of materials that he had assembled because within a few years it would surely be possible to program a computer to construct a grammar from a large corpus of data by the use of techniques that were already fairly well formalized
At the time, this did not seem an unreasonable attitude, though the prospect was saddening for anyone who felt, or at least hoped, that the resources of human intelligence were somewhat deeper than these procedures and techniques might reveal
Correspondingly, there was a striking decline in studies of linguistic method in the early 1950s as the most active theoretical minds turned to the problem of how an essentially closed body of technique could be applied to some new domain say, to analysis of connected discourse, or to other cultural phenomena beyond language
I arrived at Harvard as a graduate student shortly after B F Skinner had delivered his William James Lectures, later to be published in his book Verbal Behavior
Among those active in research in the philosophy or psychology of language, there was then little doubt that although details were missing, and although matters could not really be quite that simple, nevertheless a behavioristic framework of the sort Skinner had outlined would prove quite adequate to accommodate the full range of language use
There was now little reason to question the conviction of Leonard Bloomfield, Bertrand Russell, and positivistic linguists, psychologists, and philosophers in general that the framework of stimulus response psychology would soon be extended to the point where it would provide a satisfying explanation for the most mysterious of human abilities
The most radical souls felt that perhaps, in order to do full justice to these abilities, one must postulate little s’s and r’s inside the brain alongside the capital S’s and R’s that were open to immediate inspection, but this extension was not inconsistent with the general picture
The technological advances of the 1940s simply reinforced the general euphoria
Computers were on the horizon, and their imminent availability reinforced the belief that it would suffice to gain a theoretical understanding of only the simplest and most superficially obvious of phenomena everything else would merely prove to be “more of the same,” an apparent complexity that would be disentangled by the electronic marvels
The sound spectrograph, developed during the war, offered similar promise for the physical analysis of speech sounds
The interdisciplinary conferences on speech analysis of the early 1950s make interesting reading today
There were few so benighted as to question the possibility, in fact the immediacy, of a final solution to the problem of converting speech into writing by available engineering technique
And just a few years later, it was jubilantly discovered that machine translation and automatic abstracting were also just around the corner
For those who sought a more mathematical formulation of the basic processes, there was the newly developed mathematical theory of communication, which, it was widely believed in the early 1950s, had provided a fundamental concept the concept of “information” that would unify the social and behavioral sciences and permit the development of a solid and satisfactory mathematical theory of human behavior on a probabilistic base
At about the same time, the theory of automata developed as an independent study, making use of closely related mathematical notions
And it was linked at once, and quite properly, to earlier explorations of the theory of neural nets
There were those John von Neumann, for example who felt that the entire development was dubious and shaky at best, and probably quite misconceived, but such qualms did not go far to dispel the feeling that mathematics, technology, and behavioristic linguistics and psychology were converging on a point of view that was very simple, very clear, and fully adequate to provide a basic understanding of what tradition had left shrouded in mystery
In the United States at least, there is little trace today of the illusions of the early postwar years
If we consider the current status of structural linguistic methodology, stimulus response psycholinguistics (whether or not extended to “mediation theory”), or probabilistic or automata theoretic models for language use, we find that in each case a parallel development has taken place: a careful analysis has shown that insofar as the system of concepts and principles that was advanced can be made precise, it can be demonstrated to be inadequate in a fundamental way
The kinds of structures that are realizable in terms of these theories are simply not those that must be postulated to underlie the use of language, if empirical conditions of adequacy are to be satisfied
What is more, the character of the failure and inadequacy is such as to give little reason to believe that these approaches are on the right track
That is, in each case it has been argued quite persuasively, in my opinion that the approach is not only inadequate but misguided in basic and important ways
It has, I believe, become quite clear that if we are ever to understand how language is used or acquired, then we must abstract for separate and independent study a cognitive system, a system of knowledge and belief, that develops in early childhood and that interacts with many other factors to determine the kinds of behavior that we observe; to introduce a technical term, we must isolate and study the system of linguistic competence that underlies behavior but that is not realized in any direct or simple way in behavior
And this system of linguistic competence is qualitatively different from anything that can be described in terms of the taxonomic methods of structural linguistics, the concepts of S R psychology, or the notions developed within the mathematical theory of communication or the theory of simple automata
The theories and models that were developed to describe simple and immediately given phenomena cannot incorporate the real system of linguistic competence; “extrapolation” for simple descriptions cannot approach the reality of linguistic competence; mental structures are not simply “more of the same” but are qualitatively different from the complex networks and structures that can be developed by elaboration of the concepts that seemed so promising to many scientists just a few years ago
What is involved is not a matter of degree of complexity but rather a quality of complexity
Correspondingly, there is no reason to expect that the available technology can provide significant insight or understanding or useful achievements; it has noticeably failed to do so, and, in fact, an appreciable investment of time, energy, and money in the use of computers for linguistic research appreciable by the standards of a small field like linguistics has not provided any significant advance in our understanding of the use or nature of language
These judgments are harsh, but I think they are defensible
They are, furthermore, hardly debated by active linguistic or psycholinguistic researchers
At the same time there have been significant advances, I believe, in our understanding of the nature of linguistic competence and some of the ways in which it is put to use, but these advances, such as they are, have proceeded from assumptions very different from those that were so enthusiastically put forth in the period I have been discussing
What is more, these advances have not narrowed the gap between what is known and what can be seen to lie beyond the scope of present understanding and technique; rather, each advance has made it clear that these intellectual horizons are far more remote than was heretofore imagined
Finally, it has become fairly clear, it seems to me, that the assumptions and approaches that appear to be productive today have a distinctly traditional flavor to them; in general, a much despised tradition has been largely revitalized in recent years and its contributions given some serious and, I believe, welldeserved attention
From the recognition of these facts flows the general and quite healthy attitude of skepticism that I spoke of earlier
In short, it seems to me quite appropriate, at this moment in the development of linguistics and psychology in general, to turn again to classical questions and to ask what new insights have been achieved that bear on them, and how the classical issues may provide direction for contemporary research and study
When we turn to the history of study and speculation concerning the nature of mind and, more specifically, the nature of human language, our attention quite naturally comes to focus on the seventeenth century, “the century of genius,” in which the foundations of modern science were firmly established and the problems that still confound us were formulated with remarkable clarity and perspicuity
There are many far from superficial respects in which the intellectual climate of today resembles that of seventeenth century Western Europe
One, particularly crucial in the present context, is the very great interest in the potentialities and capacities of automata, a problem that intrigued the seventeenth century mind as fully as it does our own
I mentioned above that there is a slowly dawning realization that a significant gap more accurately, a yawning chasm separates the system of concepts of which we have a fairly clear grasp, on the one hand, and the nature of human intelligence, on the other
A similar realization lies at the base of Cartesian philosophy
Descartes also arrived, quite early in his investigations, at the conclusion that the study of mind faces us with a problem of quality of complexity, not merely degree of complexity
He felt that he had demonstrated that understanding and will, the two fundamental properties of the human mind, involved capacities and principles that are not realizable by even the most complex of automata
It is particularly interesting to trace the development of this argument in the works of the minor and now quite forgotten Cartesian philosophers, like Cordemoy, who wrote a fascinating treatise extending Descartes’ few remarks about language, or La Forge, who produced a long and detailed Traite d ´ e l’esprit de l’homme expressing, so he claimed with some reason, what Descartes would likely have said about this subject had he lived to extend his theory of man beyond physiology
One may question the details of this argument, and one can show how it was impeded and distorted by certain remnants of scholastic doctrine the framework of substance and mode, for example
But the general structure of the argument is not unreasonable; it is, in fact, rather analogous to the argument against the framework of ideas of the early postwar years, which I mentioned at the outset of this lecture
The Cartesians tried to show that when the theory of corporeal body is sharpened and clarified and extended to its limits, it is still incapable of accounting for facts that are obvious to introspection and that are also confirmed by our observation of the actions of other humans
In particular, it cannot account for the normal use of human language, just as it cannot explain the basic properties of thought
Consequently, it becomes necessary to invoke an entirely new principle in Cartesian terms, to postulate a second substance whose essence is thought, alongside of bodywith its essential properties of extension and motion
This new principle has a “creative aspect,” which is evidenced most clearly in what we may refer to as “the creative aspect of language use,” the distinctively human ability to express new thoughts and to understand entirely new expressions of thought, within the framework of an “instituted language,” a language that is a cultural product subject to laws and principles partially unique to it and partially reflections of general properties of mind
These laws and principles, it is maintained, are not formulable in terms of even the most elaborate extension of the concepts proper to the analysis of behavior and interaction of physical bodies, and they are not realizable by even the most complex automaton
In fact, Descartes argued that the only sure indication that another body possesses a human mind, that it is not a mere automaton, is its ability to use language in the normal way; and he argued that this ability cannot be detected in an animal or an automaton which, in other respects, shows signs of apparent intelligence exceeding those of a human, even though such an organism or machine might be as fully endowed as a human with the physiological organs necessary to produce speech
limate of the seventeenth century and that of today
It is illuminating, I think, to trace in somewhat greater detail the specific course of development of linguistic theory during the modern period, in the context of the study of mind and of behavior in general A good place to begin is with the writings of the Spanish physician Juan Huarte, who in the late sixteenth century published a widely translated study on the nature of human intelligence
In the course of his investigations, Huarte came to wonder at the fact that the word for “intelligence,” ingenio, seems to have the same Latin root as various words meaning “engender” or “generate” This, he argued, gives a clue to the nature of mind
Thus, “One may discern two generative powers in man, one common with the beasts and the plants, and the other participating of spiritual substance
Wit (Ingenio) is a generative power
The understanding is a generative faculty” Huarte’s etymology is actually not very good; the insight, however, is quite substantial
Huarte goes on to distinguish three levels of intelligence
The lowest of these is the “docile wit,” which satisfies the maxim that he, along with Leibnitz and many others, wrongly attributes to Aristotle, namely that there is nothing in the mind that is not simply transmitted to it by the senses
The next higher level, normal human intelligence, goes well beyond the empiricist limitation: it is able to “engender within itself, by its own power, the principles on which knowledge rests” Normal human minds are such that “assisted by the subject alone, without the help of anybody, they will produce a thousand conceits they never heard spoke of inventing and saying such things as they never heard from their masters, nor any mouth” 
Thus, normal human intelligence is capable of acquiring knowledge through its own internal resources, perhaps making use of the data of sense but going on to construct a cognitive system in terms of concepts and principles that are developed on independent grounds; and it is capable of generating new thoughts and of finding appropriate and novel ways of expressing them, in ways that entirely transcend any training or experience
Huarte postulates a third kind of wit, “by means of which some, without art or study, speak such subtle and surprising things, yet true, that were never before seen, heard, or writ, no, nor ever so much as thought of” The reference here is to true creativity, an exercise of the creative imagination in ways that go beyond normal intelligence and may, he felt, involve “a mixture of madness”Huarte’s framework is useful for discussing “psychological theory” in the ensuing period
Typical of later thought is his reference to use of language as an index of human intelligence, of what distinguishes man from animals, and, specifically, his emphasis on the creative capacity of normal intelligence
These concerns dominated rationalist psychology and linguistics
With the rise of romanticism, attention shifted to the third type of wit, to true creativity, although the rationalist assumption that normal human intelligence is uniquely free and creative and beyond the bounds of mechanical explanation was not abandoned and played an important role in the psychology of romanticism, and even in its social philosophy
As I have already mentioned, the rationalist theory of language, which was to prove extremely rich in insight and achievement, developed in part out of a concern with the problem of other minds
A fair amount of effort was devoted to a consideration of the ability of animals to follow spoken commands, to express their emotional states, to communicate with one another, and even apparently to cooperate for a common goal; all of this, it was argued, could be accounted for on “mechanical grounds,” as this notion was then understood that is, through the functioning of physiological mechanisms in terms of which one could formulate the properties of reflexes, conditioning and reinforcement, association, and so on
Animals do not lack appropriate organs of communication, nor are they simply lower along some scale of “general intelligence” In fact, as Descartes himself quite correctly observed, language is a speciesspecific human possession, and even at low levels of intelligence, at pathological levels, we find a command of language that is totally unattainable by an ape that may, in other respects, surpass a human imbecile in problem solving ability and other adaptive behavior
I will return later to the status of this observation, in the light of what is now known about animal communication
There is a basic element lacking in animals, Descartes argued, as it is lacking in even the most complex automaton that develops its “intellectual structures” completely in terms of conditioning and association namely Huarte’s second type of wit, the generative ability that is revealed in the normal human use of language as a free instrument of thought
If by experiment we convince ourselves that another organism gives evidence of the normal, creative use of language, we must suppose that it, like us, has a mind and that what it does lies beyond the bounds of mechanical explanation, outside the framework of the stimulusresponse psychology of the time, which in relevant essentials is not significantly different from that of today, though it falls short in sharpness of technique and scope and reliability of information
It should not be thought, incidentally, that the only Cartesian arguments for the beast machine hypothesis were those derived from the apparent inability of animals to manifest the creative aspect of language use
There were also many others for example, the natural fear of population explosion in the domains of the spirit if every gnat had a soul
Or the argument of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac, who argued that the beast machine hypothesis followed from the assumption of the goodness of God, since, as he pointed out, one can see “how much more humane is the doctrine that animals suffer no pain”2 Or there is the argument of Louis Racine, son of the dramatist, who was struck by the following insight: “If beasts had souls and were capable of feelings, would they show themselves insensible to the affront and injustice done them by Descartes
Would they not rather have risen up in wrath against the leader and the sect which so degraded them” One should add, I suppose, that Louis Racine was regarded by his contemporaries as the living proof that a brilliant father could not have a brilliant son
But the fact is that the discussion of the existence of other minds, and, in contrast, the mechanical nature of animals, continually returned to the creative aspect of language use, to the claim that as formulated by another minor seventeenth century figure “if beasts reasoned, they would be capable of true speech with its infinite variety” It is important to understand just what properties of language were most striking to Descartes and his followers
The discussion of what I have been calling “the creative aspect of language use” turns on three important observations
The first is that the normal use of language is innovative, in the sense that much of what we say in the course of normal language use is entirely new, not a repetition of anything that we have heard before and not even similar in pattern in any useful sense of the terms “similar” and “pattern” to sentences or discourse that we have heard in the past
This is a truism, but an important one, often overlooked and not infrequently denied in the behaviorist period of linguistics to which I referred earlier, when it was almost universally claimed that a person’s knowledge of language is representable as a stored set of patterns, overlearned However, in the Cartesian view even animal behavior is potentially infinite in its variety, in the special sense in which the readings of a speedometer can be said, with an obvious idealization, to be potentially infinite in variety
That is, if animal behavior is controlled by external stimuli or internal states (the latter including those established by conditioning), then as the stimuli vary over an indefinite range, so may the behavior of the animal
But the normal use of language is not only innovative and potentially infinite in scope, but also free from the control of detectable stimuli, either external or internal
It is because of this freedom from stimulus control that language can serve as an instrument of thought and self expression, as it does not only for the exceptionally gifted and talented, but also, in fact, for every normal human
Still, the properties of being unbounded and free from stimulus control do not, in themselves, exceed the bounds of mechanical explanation
And Cartesian discussion of the limits of mechanical explanation therefore took note of a third property of the normal use of language, namely its coherence and its “appropriateness to the situation” which of course is an entirely different matter from control by external stimuli
Just what “appropriateness” and “coherence” may consist in we cannot say in any clear or definite way, but there is no doubt that these are meaningful concepts
We can distinguish normal use of language from the ravings of a maniac or the output of a computer with a random element
Honesty forces us to admit that we are as far today as Descartes was three centuries ago from understanding just what enables a human to speak in a way that is innovative, free from stimulus control, and also appropriate and coherent
This is a serious problem that the psychologist and biologist must ultimately face and that cannot be talked out of existence by invoking “habit” or “conditioning” or “natural selection” The Cartesian analysis of the problem of other minds, in terms of the creative aspect of language use and similar indications of the limits of mechanical explanation, was not entirely satisfying to contemporary opinion Bayle’s Dictionary, for example, cites the inability to give a satisfactory proof of the existence of other minds as the weakest element in the Cartesian philosophy and there was a long and intriguing series of discussions and polemics regarding the problems that Descartes raised
From the vantage point of several centuries, we can see that the debate was inconclusive
came to be known as “philosophical” or “universal” grammar
Unfortunately, philosophical grammar is very poorly known today
There are few technical or scholarly studies, and these few are apologetic and disparaging
References to philosophical grammar in modern treatises on language are so distorted as to be quite worthless
Even a scholar with such high standards as Leonard Bloomfield gives an account of philosophical grammar in his major work, Language, that bears almost no resemblance to the original and attributes to this tradition views diametrically opposed to those that were most typical of it
For example, Bloomfield and many others describe philosophical grammar as based on a Latin model, as prescriptive, as showing no interest in the sounds of speech, as given to a confusion of speech with writing
All these charges are false, and it is important to dispel these myths to make possible an objective evaluation of what was actually accomplished
It is particularly ironic that philosophical grammar should be accused of a Latin bias
In fact, it is significant that the original works the Port Royal Grammar and Logic, in particular were written in French, the point being that they formed part of the movement to replace Latin by the vernacular
The fact is that Latin was regarded as an artificial and distorted language, one positively injurious to the exercise of the plain thinking and common sense discourse by which the Cartesians set such store
The practitioners of philosophical grammar used such linguistic materials as were available to them; it is noteworthy that some of the topics that were studied with the greatest care and persistence for well over a century involved points of grammar that do not even have an analogue in Latin
A striking example is the so called rule of Vaugelas, which involves the relation between indefinite articles and relative clauses in French
For 150 years the rule of Vaugelas was the central issue debated in the controversy over the possibility of developing a “rational grammar,” one which would go beyond description to achieve a rational explanation for phenomena
No doubt it is a complete misunderstanding of the issue of rational explanation that leads to the charge of “prescriptivism” that is leveled, quite erroneously, against philosophical grammar
In fact, there is no issue of prescriptivism
It was well understood and frequently reiterated that the facts of usage are what they are, and that it is not the place of the grammarian to legislate
At stake was an entirely different matter, namely the problem of accounting for the facts of usage on the basis of explanatory hypotheses concerning the nature of language and, ultimately, the nature of human thought
Philosophical grammarians had little interest in the accumulation of data, except insofar as such data could be used as evidence bearing on deeper processes of great generality
The contrast The whole matter is not without interest
I mentioned earlier that there are striking similarities between the seventeenth century climate of opinion and that of contemporary cognitive psychology and linguistics
One point of similarity has to do with precisely this matter of explanatory theory
Philosophical grammar, very much like current generative grammar, developed in self conscious opposition to a descriptive tradition that interpreted the task of the grammarian to be merely that of recording and organizing the data of usage a kind of natural history
It maintained quite correctly, I believe that such a restriction was debilitating and unnecessary and that, whatever justification it may have, it has nothing to do with the method of science which is typically concerned with data not for itself but as evidence for deeper, hidden organizing principles, principles that cannot be detected “in the phenomena” nor derived from them by taxonomic data processing operations, any more than the principles of celestial mechanics could have been developed in conformity with such strictures
Contemporary scholarship is not in a position to give a definitive assessment of the achievements of philosophical grammar
The ground work has not been laid for such an assessment, the original work is all but unknown in itself, and much of it is almost unobtainable
For example, I have been unable to locate a single copy, in the United States, of the only critical edition of the Port Royal Grammar, produced over a century ago; and although the French original is now once again available,3 the one English translation of this important work is apparently to be found only in the British Museum
It is a pity that this work should have been so totally disregarded, since what little is known about it is intriguing and quite illuminating
This is not the place to attempt a preliminary assessment of this work or even to sketch its major outlines as they now appear, on the basis of present, quite inadequate knowledge
However, I do want to mention at least a few of the persistent themes
It seems that one of the innovations of the Port Royal Grammar of 1660 the work that initiated the tradition of philosophical grammar was its recognition of the importance of the notion of the phrase as a grammatical unit
Earlier grammar had been largely a grammar of word classes and inflections
In the Cartesian theory of Port Royal, a phrase corresponds to a complex idea and a sentence is subdivided into consecutive phrases, which are further subdivided into phrases, and so on, until the level of the word is reached
In this way we derive what might be called the “surface structure” of the sentence in question
To use what became a standard example, the sentence “Invisible God created the visible world” contains the subject “invisible God”There is a similarity, which I think can be highly misleading, between the theory of deep and surface structure and a much older tradition
The practitioners of philosophical grammar were very careful to stress this similarity in their detailed development of the theory and had no hesitation in expressing their debt to classical grammar as well as to such major figures of renaissance grammar as the Spanish scholar Sanctius
Sanctius, in particular, had developed a theory of ellipsis that had great influence on philosophical grammar
As I have already remarked, philosophical grammar is poorly understood today
But such antecedents as Sanctius have fallen into total oblivion
Furthermore, as in the case of all such work, there is a problem of determining not only what he said but also, more importantly, what he meant
There is no doubt that in developing his concept of ellipsis as a fundamental property of language, Sanctius gave many linguistic examples that superficially are closely parallel to those that were used to develop the theory of deep and surface structure, both in classical philosophical grammar and in its far more explicit modern variants
It means, however, that the concept of ellipsis is intended by Sanctius merely as a device for the interpretation of texts
Thus, to determine the true meaning of an actual literary passage one must very often, according to Sanctius, regard it as an elliptical variant of a more elaborate paraphrase
But the Port Royal theory and its later development, particularly at the hands of the encyclopedist Du Marsais, gave a rather different interpretation to ellipsis
The clear intent of philosophical grammar was to develop a psychological theory, not a technique of textual interpretation
The theory holds that the underlying deep structure, with its abstract organization of linguistic forms, is “present to the mind,” as the signal, with its surface structure, is produced or perceived by the bodily organs
And the transformational operations relating deep and surface structure are actual mental operations, performed by the mind when a sentence is produced or understood
The distinction is fundamental
Under the latter interpretation, it follows that there must be, represented in the mind, a fixed system of generative principles that characterize and associate deep and surface structures in some definite way–a grammar, in other words, that is used in some fashion as discourse is produced or interpreted
This grammar represents the underlying linguistic competence to which I referred earlier
The problem of determining the character of such grammars and the principles that govern them is a typical problem of science, perhaps very difficult, but in principle admitting of definite answers that are right or wrong as they do or do not correspond to the mental reality
But the theory of ellipsis as a technique of textual interpretation need not consist of a set of principles represented somehow in the mind as an aspect of normal human competence and intelligence
Rather, it can be in part ad hoc and can involve many cultural and personal
The Port Royal theory of deep and surface structure belongs to psychology as an attempt to elaborate Huarte’s second type of wit, as an exploration of the properties of normal human intelligence
The concept of ellipsis in Sanctius, if I understand it correctly, is one of many techniques, to be applied as conditions warrant and having no necessary mental representation as an aspect of a normal intelligence
Although the linguistic examples used are often similar, the context in which they are introduced and the framework in which they fit are fundamentally different; in particular, they are separated by the Cartesian revolution
I propose this with some diffidence, because of the obscurity of the relevant texts and their intellectual backgrounds, but this interpretation seems to me correct
The relation of the Port Royal theory to modern structural and descriptive linguistics is somewhat clearer
The latter restricts itself to the analysis of what I have called surface structure, to formal properties that are explicit in the signal and to phrases and units that can be determined from the signal by techniques of segmentation and classification
This restriction is a perfectly self conscious one, and it was regarded–I believe quite erroneously as a great advance
The great Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who at the turn of the century laid the groundwork for modern structural linguistics, put forth the view that the only proper methods of linguistic analysis are segmentation and classification
Applying these methods, the linguist determines the patterns into which the units so analyzed fall, where these patterns are either syntagmatic that is, patterns of literal succession in the stream of speech or paradigmatic that is, relations among units that occupy the same position in the stream of speech
He held that when all such analysis is complete, the structure of the language is, of necessity, completely revealed, and the science of linguistics will have realized its task completely
Evidently, such taxonomic analysis leaves no place for deep structure in the sense of philosophical grammar
For example, the system of three propositions underlying the sentence “Invisible God created the visible world” cannot be derived from this sentence by segmentation and classification of segmented units, nor can the transformational operations relating the deep and surface structure, in this case, be expressed in terms of paradigmatic and syntagmatic structures
Modern structural linguistics has been faithful to these limitations, which were held to be necessary limitations
In fact, Saussure in some respects even went beyond this in departing from the tradition of philosophical grammar
He occasionally expressed the view that processes of sentence formation do not belong to the system of language at all that the system of language is restricted to such linguistic units as sounds and words and perhaps a few fixed phrases and a small number of very general patterns; the mechanisms of sentence formation are otherwise free from any constraint imposed by linguistic structure as such
Thus, in his terms, sentence formation is not strictly a matter of langue, but is rather assigned to what he called parole, and thus placed outside the scope of linguistics proper; it is a process of free creation, unconstrained by linguistic rule except insofar as such rules govern the forms of words and the patterns of sounds
Syntax, in this view, is a rather trivial matter
And, in fact, there is very little work in syntax throughout the period of structural linguistics
In taking this position, Saussure echoed an important critique of Humboldtian linguistic theory by the distinguished American linguist William Dwight Whitney, who evidently greatly influenced Saussure
According to Whitney, Humboldtian linguistic theory, which in many ways extended the Cartesian views that I have been discussing, was fundamentally in error
Rather, a language is simply “made up of a vast number of items, each of which has its own time, occasion, and effect” He maintained that “language in the concrete sense is the sum of words and phrases by which any man expresses his thought”; the task of the linguist, then, is to list these linguistic forms and to study their individual histories
In contrast to philosophical grammar, Whitney argued that there is nothing universal about the form of language and that one can learn nothing about the general properties of human intelligence from the study of the arbitrary agglomeration of forms that constitutes a human language
As he put it, “The infinite diversity of human speech ought alone to be a sufficient bar to the assertion that an understanding of the powers of the soul involves the explanation of speech” Similarly, Delbr¨uck, in the standard work on IndoEuropean comparative syntax, denounced traditional grammar for having set up ideal sentence types underlying the observed signals, referring to Sanctius as the “major dogmatist in this domain” With the expression of such sentiments as these, we enter the modern age of the study of language
The death knell of philosophical grammar was sounded with the remarkable successes of comparative Indo European studies, which surely rank among the outstanding achievements of nineteenth century science
The impoverished and thoroughly inadequate conception of language expressed by Whitney and Saussure and numerous others proved to be entirely appropriate to the current stage of linguistic research
As a result, this conception was held to be vindicated, a not unnatural but thoroughly mistaken conviction
Modern structural descriptive linguistics developed within the same intellectual framework and also made substantial progress, to which I will return directly
In contrast, philosophical grammar did not provide appropriate concepts for the new comparative grammar or for the study of exotic languages unknown to the investigator, and it was, in a sense, exhausted
It had reached the limits of what could be achieved within the framework of the ideas and techniques that were available
There was no clear understanding a century ago as to how marvellous invention” (in the words of the Port Royal Grammar) “by which we construct from twenty five or thirty sounds an infinity of expressions, which, having no resemblance in themselves to what takes place in our minds, still enable us to let others know the secret of what we conceive and of all the various mental activities that we carry out” Thus, the study of language had arrived at a situation in which there was, on the one hand, a set of simple concepts that provided the basis for some startling successes and, on the other, some deep but rather vague ideas that did not seem to lead to any further productive research
The outcome was inevitable and not at all to be deplored
There developed a professionalization of the field, a shift of interest away from the classical problems of general interest to intellectuals like Arnauld and Humboldt, for example, toward a new domain largely defined by the techniques that the profession itself has forged in the solution of certain problems
Such a development is natural and quite proper, but not without its dangers
Without wishing to exalt the cult of gentlemanly amateurism, one must nevertheless recognize that the classical issues have a liveliness and significance that may be lacking in an area of investigation that is determined by the applicability of certain tools and methods, rather than by problems that are of intrinsic interest in themselves
The moral is not to abandon useful tools; rather, it is, first, that one should maintain enough perspective to be able to detect the arrival of that inevitable day when the research that can be conducted with these tools is no longer important; and, second, that one should value ideas and insights that are to the point, though perhaps premature and vague and not productive of research at a particular stage of technique and understanding
With the benefits of hindsight, I think we can now see clearly that the disparagement and neglect of a rich tradition proved in the long run to be quite harmful to the study of language
Furthermore, this disparagement and neglect were surely unnecessary
Perhaps it would have been psychologically difficult, but there is no reason in principle why the successful exploitation of the structuralist approach in historical and descriptive study could not have been coupled with a clear recognition of its essential limitations and its ultimate inadequacy, in comparison with the tradition it temporarily, and quite justifiably, displaced
Here, I think, lies a lesson that may be valuable for the future study of language and mind
the scope of information available to us and has extended immeasurably the reliability of such data
It has shown that there are structural relations in language that can be studied abstractly
It has raised the precision of discourse about language to entirely new levels
But I think that its major contribution may prove to be one for which, paradoxically, it has been very severely criticized
I refer to the careful and serious attempt to construct “discovery procedures,” those techniques of segmentation and classification to which Saussure referred
This attempt was a failure–I think that is now generally understood
It was a failure because such techniques are at best limited to the phenomena of surface structure and cannot, therefore, reveal the mechanisms that underlie the creative aspect of language use and the expression of semantic content
But what remains of fundamental importance is that this attempt was directed to the basic question in the study of language, which was for the first time formulated in a clear and intelligible way
The problem raised is that of specifying the mechanisms that operate on the data of sense and produce knowledge of language linguistic competence
It is obvious that such mechanisms exist
Children do learn a first language; the language that they learn is, in the traditional sense, an “instituted language,” not an innately specified system
The answer that was proposed in structural linguistic methodology has been shown to be incorrect, but this is of small importance when compared with the fact that the problem itself has now received a clear formulation
Whitehead once described the mentality of modern science as having been forged through “the union of passionate interest in the detailed facts with equal devotion to abstract generalization” It is roughly accurate to describe modern linguistics as passionately interested in detailed fact, and philosophical grammar as equally devoted to abstract generalization
It seems to me that the time has arrived to unite these two major currents and to develop a synthesis that will draw from their respective achievements
In the next two lectures, I will try to illustrate how the tradition of philosophical grammar can be reconstituted and turned to new and challenging problems and how one can, finally, return in a productive way to the basic questions and concerns that gave rise to this tradition
One difficulty in the psychological sciences lies in the familiarity of the phenomena with which they deal
A certain intellectual effort is required to see how such phenomena can pose serious problems or call for intricate explanatory theories
One is inclined to take them for granted as necessary or somehow “natural” The effects of this familiarity of phenomena have often been discussed
Wolfgang K¨ohler, for example, has suggested that psychologists do not open up “entirely new territories” in the manner of the natural sciences, “simply because man was acquainted with practically all territories of mental life a long time before the founding of scientific psychology  because at the very beginning of their work there were no entirely unknown mental facts left which they could have discovered”1 The most elementary discoveries of classical physics have a certain shock value man has no intuition about elliptical orbits or the gravitational constant
But “mental facts” of even a much deeper sort cannot be “discovered” by the psychologist, because they are a matter of intuitive acquaintance and, once pointed out, are obvious
There is also a more subtle effect
Phenomena can be so familiar that we really do not see them at all, a matter that has been much discussed by literary theorists and philosophers
For example, Viktor Shklovskij in the early 1920s developed the idea that the function of poetic art is that of “making strange” the object depicted
“People living at the seashore grow so accustomed to the murmur of the waves that they never hear it
By the same token, we scarcely ever hear the words which we utter 
We look at each other, but we do not see each other any more
Our perception of the world has withered away; what has remained is mere recognition” Thus, the goal of the artist is to transfer what is depicted to the “sphere of new perception”; as an example, Shklovskij cites a story by Tolstoy in which social customs and institutions are “made strange” by the device of presenting them from the viewpoint of a narrator who happens to be a horse
The observation that “we look at each other, but we do not see each other any more” has perhaps itself achieved the status of “words which we utter but scarcely ever hear” But familiarity, in this case as well, should not obscure the importance of the insight
Wittgenstein makes a similar observation, pointing out that “the aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity (one is unable to notice something because it is always before one’s eyes)”3 He sets himself to “supplying remarks on the natural history of human beings: we are not contributing curiosities however, but observations which no one has doubted, but which have escaped remark only because they are always before our eyes”4 
Less noticed is the fact that we also lose sight of the need for explanation when phenomena are too familiar and “obvious” We tend too easily to assume that explanations must be transparent and close to the surface
The greatest defect of classical philosophy of mind, both rationalist and empiricist, seems to me to be its unquestioned assumption that the properties and content of the mind are accessible to introspection; it is surprising to see how rarely this assumption has been challenged, insofar as the organization and function of the intellectual faculties are concerned, even with the Freudian revolution
Correspondingly, the far reaching studies of language that were carried out under the influence of Cartesian rationalism suffered from a failure to appreciate either the abstractness of those structures that are “present to the mind” when an utterance is produced or understood, or the length and complexity of the chain of operations that relate the mental structures expressing the semantic content of the utterance to the physical realization
A similar defect mars the study of language and mind in the modern period
It seems to me that the essential weakness in the structuralist and behaviorist approaches to these topics is the faith in the shallowness of explanations, the belief that the mind must be simpler in its structure than any known physical organ and that the most primitive of assumptions must be adequate to explain whatever phenomena can be observed
Thus, it is taken for granted without argument or evidence (or is presented as true by definition) that a language is a “habit structure” or a network of associative connections, or that knowledge of language is merely a matter of “knowing how,” a skill expressible as a system of dispositions to respond
Accordingly, knowledge of language must develop slowly through repetition and training, its apparent complexity resulting from the proliferation of very simple elements rather than from deeper principles of mental organization that may be as inaccessible to introspection as the mechanisms of digestion or coordinated movement
Although there is nothing inherently unreasonable in an attempt to account for knowledge and use of language in these terms, it also has no particular plausibility or a priori justification
There is no reason to react with uneasiness or disbelief if study of the knowledge of language and use of this knowledge should lead in an entirely different direction
I think that in order to achieve progress in the study of language and human cognitive faculties in general it is necessary first to establish “psychic distance” from the “mental facts” to which K¨ohler referred, and then to explore the possibilities for developing explanatory theories, whatever they may suggest with regard to the complexity and abstractness of the underlying mechanisms
We must recognize that even the most familiar phenomena require explanation and that we have no privileged access to the underlying mechanisms, no more so than in physiology or physics
Only the most preliminary and tentative hypotheses can be offered concerning the nature of language, its use, and its acquisition
As native speakers, we have a vast amount of data available to us
For just this reason it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that there is nothing to be explained, that whatever organizing principles and underlying mechanisms may exist must be “given” as the data is given
Nothing could be further from the truth, and an attempt to characterize precisely the system of rules we have mastered that enables us to understand new sentences and produce a new sentence on an appropriate occasion will quickly dispel any dogmatism on this matter
The search for explanatory theories must begin with an attempt to determine these systems of rules and to reveal the principles that govern them
The person who has acquired knowledge of a language has internalized a system of rules that relate sound and meaning in a particular way
The linguist constructing a grammar of a language is in effect proposing a hypothesis concerning this internalized system
The linguist’s hypothesis, if presented with sufficient explicitness and precision, will have certain empirical consequences with regard to the form of utterances and their interpretations by the native speaker
Evidently, knowledge of language the internalized system of rules is only one of the many factors that determine how an utterance will be used or understood in a particular situation
The linguist who is trying to determine what constitutes knowledge of a language to construct a correct grammar is studying one fundamental factor that is involved in performance, but not the only one
This idealization must be kept in mind when one is considering the problem of confirmation of grammars on the basis of empirical evidence
There is no reason why one should not also study the interaction of several factors involved in complex mental acts and underlying actual performance, but such a study is not likely to proceed very far unless the separate factors are themselves fairly well understood
In a good sense, the grammar proposed by the linguist is an explanatory theory; it suggests an explanation for the fact that (under the idealization mentioned) a speaker of the language in question will perceive, interpret, form, or use an utterance in certain ways and not in other ways
One can also search for explanatory theories of a deeper sort
The native speaker has acquired a grammar on the basis of very restricted and degenerate evidence; the grammar has empirical consequences that extend far beyond the evidence
At one level, the phenomena with which the grammar deals are explained by the rules of the grammar itself and the interaction of these rules
At a deeper level, these same phenomena are explained by the principles that determine the selection of the grammar on the basis of the restricted and degenerate evidence available to the person who has acquired knowledge of the language, who has constructed for himself this particular grammar
The principles that determine the form of grammar and that select a grammar of the appropriate form on the basis of certain data constitute a subject that might, following a traditional usage, be termed “universal grammar” The study of universal grammar, so understood, is a study of the nature of human intellectual capacities
It tries to formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions that a system must meet to qualify as a potential human language, conditions that are not accidentally true of the existing human languages, but that are rather rooted in the human “language capacity,” and thus constitute the innate organization that determines what counts as linguistic experience and what knowledge of language arises on the basis of this experience
Universal grammar, then, constitutes an explanatory theory of a much deeper sort than particular grammar, although the particular grammar of a language can also be regarded as an explanatory theory5 In practice, the linguist is always involved in the study of both universal and particular grammar
When he constructs a descriptive, particular grammar in one way rather than another on the basis of what evidence he has available, he is guided, consciously or not, by certain assumptions as to the form of grammar, and these assumptions belong to the theory of universal grammar
Conversely, his formulation of principles of universal grammar must be justified by the study of their consequences when applied in particular grammars
Thus, at several levels the linguist is involved in the construction of explanatory theories, and at each level there is a clear psychological interpretation for his theoretical and descriptive work
At the level of particular grammar, he is attempting to characterize knowledge of a language, a certain cognitive system that has been developed unconsciously, of course by the normal speaker–hearer
At the level of universal grammar, he is trying to establish certain general propertie
